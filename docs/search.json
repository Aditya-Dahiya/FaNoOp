    "text": "Germans have sent the most postcards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA closer look at Germany vs. other top postcrossing nations.\nWhile Germany doesn’t have the maximum number of members on postcrossing, it makes up by sending more postcards on average, per member.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the following countries have higher percentage of their population registered as members on postcrossing. But, Germans make up for that by a combination of more postcard sent per person and a larger population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo the elderly send more postcards? Or, is it due to some other underlying cause?\nWhen we look at the relation of postcards sent per member to the ageing of population in countries, we find: –\n\nCountries with more elderly population also send more postcards, on average\nCountries with higher proportion of young people in the population send fewer postcards per member, on average.\n\nHowever, as we will see later, wealth (GDP per capita) explains the postcard numbers better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, we take a closer look at the top 100 postcrossers - of all time and of last 60 days: –\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking closely at the postcrossers who figure both in the Top 100 of all time and Top 100 of last 60 days, we find that in the top 100, Americans are rising in ranks lately. Amongst users who figure in both the all time top 100 and last 60 days lists of top 100, Americans have moved up and Germans have fallen in ranks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s delve into other indicators that could explain why some countries send more postcards than others !\nWe use the following variables as predictors in our model to predict the Average number of postcards sent by a member in each country: –\n\nAge dependency ratio, old (% of working-age population),\nPopulation ages 65 and above (% of total population),\nPopulation ages 0-14 (% of total population),\nGDP per capita (current US$)\n\nWhen we analyze the predictors, the techincal results are shown below. It seems that only the GDP per capita correlates with the Average number of postcards sent by a member in each country. On the contrary, being elderly or young has no correlation with the Average number of postcards sent.\n\n\n\nRegression results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage number of postcards sent by each member\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBi-variable models\n\n\nTwo variables\n\n\nAll vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n(7)\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge dependency ratio, old (% of working-age population)\n\n\n2.1***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\n(11.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation ages 65 and above (% of total population)\n\n\n\n\n3.3***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n-9.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.1)\n\n\n\n\n(19.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation ages 0-14 (% of total population)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2.0***\n\n\n-2.0***\n\n\n-0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\n(0.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation ages 0-14 (% of total population)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.001***\n\n\n0.001***\n\n\n0.001***\n\n\n0.001***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\nF Statistic\n\n\n11.4***\n\n\n11.1***\n\n\n7.5***\n\n\n7.5***\n\n\n8.8***\n\n\n9.8***\n\n\n9.9***\n\n\n5.1***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\np&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01\n\n\n\n\nThus, the most important correlation of Average number of postcards sent by a member is with wealth, the GDP per capita. This relation is depicted below in Figure 1 .\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Average number of postcards sent correlates with the wealth of the country, i.e., GDP per capita\n\n\n\n\nNow, lets try to see what could explain the different number of members in different countries, i.e. Percentage of the population that is registered on postcrossing.com. We see in the table below that the most important predictor of postcrossing member’s proportion in a population is the share of elderly population. Also, we see the fast growing populations have lower postcrossing members.\nAll this strongly indicates that number of postcrossing members is correlated with an elderly population, and a slow growing population.\n\n\n\nRegression results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostcrossing members as a proportion of population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne covariate models\n\n\nTwo Covariates\n\n\nAll covariates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n(7)\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP per capita (current US)\n\n\n0.000***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.000\n\n\n0.000***\n\n\n-0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment to population ratio, 15+, total (%) (modeled ILO estimate)\n\n\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.00000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.00000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.00000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation ages 65 and above (% of total population)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.00004***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.00003***\n\n\n\n\n0.00005***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.00001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.00001)\n\n\n\n\n(0.00001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation growth (annual %)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.0001***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.0001**\n\n\n0.0001*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.00003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.00003)\n\n\n(0.00004)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation, total\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.083\n\n\n0.0002\n\n\n0.238\n\n\n0.044\n\n\n-0.002\n\n\n0.234\n\n\n0.107\n\n\n0.248\n\n\n\n\nF Statistic\n\n\n15.270***\n\n\n1.034\n\n\n49.998***\n\n\n8.282***\n\n\n0.667\n\n\n24.966***\n\n\n10.387***\n\n\n11.379***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\np&lt;0.1; p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, some interesting correlations: –\n\nThere seems to be no apparent co-relation between the number of people within a country using postcrossing, and the average number of postcards sent by each person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as the percentage of population using postcrossing grows, so does the average number of postcards sent by each person."

Being elderly or young has no correlation with the Average number of postcards sent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage number of postcards sent by each member\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBi-variable models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll vars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge dependency ratio, old (% of working-age population)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(11.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation ages 65 and above (% of total population)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-9.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(19.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation ages 0-14 (% of total population)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2.0***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-2.0***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation ages 0-14 (% of total population)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.001***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.001***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.001***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.001***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF Statistic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.8***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.8***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.9***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np&lt;0.1;

We see in ?@tbl-regression-2 that the most important predictor of postcrossing member’s proportion in a population is the share of elderly population. Also, we see the fast growing populations have lower postcrossing members.\nAll is strongly indicates that postcrossing members’ numbers is primarily correlated with an elderly population which is slow

    "text": "The bottom line: –\n\nPostcrossing is most popular in nordic and eastern European countries, and catching up in USA and China.\nCountries with higher percentage of elderly people also have higher percentage of population registered on postcrossing.\nBeing elderly or young has no correlation with the number of postcards sent. Instead, it is wealth (GDP per capita) that correlates with the number of postcards sent on average by a member, in a country.\n\n\nHappy postcrossing on the World Postcards Day - October 1!"
